# Combat Mechanix Database Integration

## Overview
Combat Mechanix has been successfully integrated with your existing GameDB database on Beast4070\CM01. The application now uses direct SQL Server access instead of Entity Framework for better performance and control.

## Database Configuration
- **Server**: Beast4070\CM01
- **Database**: GameDB  
- **Table**: Players (existing table with full player data)
- **Connection**: Windows Authentication with trusted connection

## Schema Mapping
The existing `Players` table maps to the Combat Mechanix PlayerStats model:

| GameDB Column | PlayerStats Field | Type Conversion |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| PlayerId | PlayerId | Direct mapping |
| PlayerName | PlayerName | Direct mapping |
| Level | Level | Direct mapping |
| Experience | Experience | int → long |
| Health/MaxHealth | Health/MaxHealth | float → int |
| Defense | Defense | float → int |
| AttackDamage | Strength | float → int |
| MovementSpeed | Speed | float → int |
| PositionX/Y/Z | LastPosition | Combined to Vector3Data |
| LastLogin | LastLogin | Direct mapping |
| CreatedAt | CreatedAt | Direct mapping |
| LastSave | UpdatedAt | Direct mapping |

## Features
✅ **Working Integration**: Database connection established and tested  
✅ **Type Safety**: Safe conversion between database and model types  
✅ **Existing Data**: Uses your existing Players table with all historical data  
✅ **Performance**: Direct SQL queries without ORM overhead  
✅ **Compatibility**: Unity client integration unchanged  

## Testing
1. **Start Server**: `dotnet run` from CombatMechanix directory
2. **Verify Connection**: Look for "Database connection successful" in logs
3. **Unity Integration**: Connect Unity client - player stats will be loaded from GameDB
4. **Data Persistence**: All changes (experience, level, health) save to existing Players table

## Server Startup
```bash
cd CombatMechanix
dotnet run
```

Expected output:
```
info: CombatMechanix[0]
      Database connection successful
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5207
```

## Additional Tables Available
Your GameDB also contains rich game data that could be integrated later:
- **CombatEvents** - Combat history and damage tracking
- **PlayerInventory** - Item management system  
- **ResourceNodes** - Resource gathering system
- **ChatMessages** - In-game communication logs
- **PlayerDeaths** - Death/respawn tracking

The current integration focuses on core player stats, but the foundation is set for expanding to use these additional tables as needed.
